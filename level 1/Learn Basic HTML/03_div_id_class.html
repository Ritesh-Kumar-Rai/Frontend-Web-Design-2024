    <!-- What is div tag ? -->
    <!-- div tag is a rectangular shaped container which has 0 height by default but certain width 
        
        Uses of div :
            1. When you want a rectnagular or any other shapes in your website/webpage
                e.g : Square, Rectangle, Circle, Traingle, cylinder etc.

            2. When you want to wrap or hold more than 1 element into a single one 
                (block/container) then we use div tag    
    -->

    <!-- Syntax : -->
    <div></div>
    <div>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</div>


    <!-- what is id ? -->
    <!-- id is an attribute which can be added to any html tags, it it used 
        to uniquely identify single element [focus single element only]
        you cannot make more than 1 tag as same id.

        uses :
            to target specific single element and changed, get value, access it 
            using css, js, etc
        Example :
            If i say change the color of God to blue, how can you change
            by using it's id    
    -->
    <p id="god">God</p>
    <p id="demigod">DemiGod</p>


    <!-- what is class ? -->
    <!-- class is also an attribute which can be added to any html tags, it is used
        to target more than one elements in html to perform any manipulation, operation etc.
        unlike id you can assign more than html tags as same class name.

        uses :
            to target some of elements,
            In especially css we can target some elements those class name is same to change
             a color or anything else.

        e.g :
        See below html tags which has same classname and see above style tag which targets those 
        to change the color     
    -->

    <!-- change the color to red which has classname as number -->
    <p class="number">One</p>
    <p class="number">Two</p>
    <p class="other">Three</p>
    <p class="number">Four</p>
    <p class="other">Five</p>
    <p class="number">Six</p>
