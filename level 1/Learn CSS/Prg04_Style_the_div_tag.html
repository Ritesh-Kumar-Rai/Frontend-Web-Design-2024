<!--
There are many ways to write sizes in CSS, and they can be divided into two categories: 
absolute units and relative units. 

*Absolute units are fixed and do not depend on the context or the device. 
*Relative units are flexible and adjust to the context or the device. 

Some examples of absolute units are:

- `px`: pixels, the smallest unit of the screen.
- `cm`: centimeters, based on physical measurements.
- `in`: inches, based on physical measurements.
- `pt`: points, 1/72 of an inch, often used for print media.
- `pc`: picas, 12 points, often used for print media.

Some examples of relative units are:

- `%`: percentage, relative to the parent element or the viewport.
- `em`: relative to the font-size of the current element.
- `rem`: relative to the font-size of the root element.
- `vw`: relative to 1% of the width of the viewport.
- `vh`: relative to 1% of the height of the viewport.
- `vmin`: relative to 1% of the smaller dimension of the viewport.
- `vmax`: relative to 1% of the larger dimension of the viewport.

The differences between these units are mainly in how they scale and adapt to different
devices and situations. Absolute units are more precise and consistent, 
but they may not look good on different screen sizes or resolutions. 
Relative units are more responsive and adaptable, but they may not be as accurate or 
predictable.
